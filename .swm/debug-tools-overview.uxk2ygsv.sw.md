title: Debug Tools Overview

Debug Tools are used to facilitate the debugging process by allowing developers to execute specific commands and actions within the game.

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/debugtools/DebugInvoker.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public class DebugInvoker">`DebugInvoker`</SwmToken> class is responsible for setting and executing commands. It holds a reference to an <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/debugtools/DebugInvoker.cs" pos="5:3:3" line-data="        private ICommand _command;">`ICommand`</SwmToken> object and provides methods to set and execute this command.

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/debugtools/DebugReceiver.cs" pos="5:5:5" line-data="    public class DebugReceiver">`DebugReceiver`</SwmToken> class maintains a list of supported commands and provides an <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/debugtools/DebugReceiver.cs" pos="8:5:5" line-data="        public void Action(string action)">`Action`</SwmToken> method to execute these commands. If an unsupported command is attempted, it throws a <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/debugtools/DebugReceiver.cs" pos="11:5:7" line-data="                throw new System.NotImplementedException();">`System.NotImplementedException`</SwmToken>.

It uses the <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/debugtools/DebugReceiver.cs" pos="5:5:5" line-data="    public class DebugReceiver">`DebugReceiver`</SwmToken> to perform the 'vardump' action.
