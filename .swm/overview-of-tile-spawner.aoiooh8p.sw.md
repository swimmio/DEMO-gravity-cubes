title: Overview of Tile Spawner
---
Tilespawner is responsible for generating and managing the different types of pieces in the game.

It includes various classes like <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/IPiece.cs" pos="7:5:5" line-data="    public class IPiece: ISpawnable">`IPiece`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="27:15:15" line-data="        private static ISpawnable SpawnSPiece() =&gt; new SPiece();">`SPiece`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="26:15:15" line-data="        private static ISpawnable SpawnOPiece() =&gt; new OPiece();">`OPiece`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="25:15:15" line-data="        private static ISpawnable SpawnLPiece() =&gt; new LPiece();">`LPiece`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="29:15:15" line-data="        private static ISpawnable SpawnZPiece() =&gt; new ZPiece();">`ZPiece`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="24:15:15" line-data="        private static ISpawnable SpawnJPiece() =&gt; new JPiece();">`JPiece`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="28:15:15" line-data="        private static ISpawnable SpawnTPiece() =&gt; new TPiece();">`TPiece`</SwmToken>, each implementing the <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/IPiece.cs" pos="7:8:8" line-data="    public class IPiece: ISpawnable">`ISpawnable`</SwmToken> interface.

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="10:5:5" line-data="    public class TileSpawnerService: IService">`TileSpawnerService`</SwmToken> class is a key component that likely handles the logic for spawning these pieces during the game.
