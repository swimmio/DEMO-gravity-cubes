The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/playfield/PlayFieldViewModel.cs" pos="14:3:3" line-data="        public PlayFieldViewModel(PlayField playField, ServiceLocator serviceLocator)">`PlayFieldViewModel`</SwmToken> is a class that implements the <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/playfield/PlayFieldViewModel.cs" pos="9:8:8" line-data="    public class PlayFieldViewModel: IUpdatable">`IUpdatable`</SwmToken> interface and serves as the view model for the playfield in the game.

It initializes the playfield with a grid of tiles, setting each tile to a default color.

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/playfield/PlayFieldViewModel.cs" pos="14:3:3" line-data="        public PlayFieldViewModel(PlayField playField, ServiceLocator serviceLocator)">`PlayFieldViewModel`</SwmToken> provides properties to access the width and height of the playfield, as well as the tiles within it.

It includes methods to get a specific tile, place a tile at a specific location, and update the playfield based on events from an event queue.

The update method dequeues events related to spawning tiles and places new tiles on the playfield accordingly.

## Initialization

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/playfield/PlayFieldViewModel.cs" pos="14:3:3" line-data="        public PlayFieldViewModel(PlayField playField, ServiceLocator serviceLocator)">`PlayFieldViewModel`</SwmToken> constructor initializes the playfield with a grid of tiles, setting each tile to a default color.

```c#
        public PlayFieldViewModel(PlayField playField, ServiceLocator serviceLocator)
        {
            _playField = playField;
            _serviceLocator = serviceLocator;
            
            for (int x = 0; x < _playField.Width; x++)
            {
                for (int y = 0; y < _playField.Height; y++)
                {
                    _playField.Field[x, y] = new Tile(Color.black);
                }
            }

## Update Method

The update method dequeues events related to spawning tiles and places new tiles on the playfield accordingly.

```c#
        public void Update()
        {
            var eventQueue = _serviceLocator.GetService<EventQueue.EventQueue>();
            var e = (SpawnTileEvent)eventQueue.Dequeue(EventId.SpawnTile);
            if (e != null)
            {
                var createTileShape = e.CreateTileShapeDelegate;
                var shape = createTileShape();
                PlaceTile(shape.Spawn(), 0, 0);
            }
        }
