title: The IService class
---
This document will cover the interface <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> in the Unity project. We will discuss:

1. What <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> is.
2. The variables and functions defined in <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken>.
3. An example of how to use <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> in <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="10:5:5" line-data="    public class TileSpawnerService: IService">`TileSpawnerService`</SwmToken>.

# What is <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken>

<SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> is an interface defined in the Unity project under the namespace <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="4:2:4" line-data="using game.service;">`game.service`</SwmToken>. It serves as a contract for service classes, ensuring that any class implementing this interface adheres to a specific structure and set of functionalities. This is useful for maintaining consistency and predictability across different service implementations in the game.

# Variables and functions

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> interface is defined here. Currently, it does not contain any variables or functions, serving as a marker interface for now.

```c#
    public interface IService
    {
        
    }
```

# Usage example

To illustrate how <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> can be used, let's look at an example with <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="10:5:5" line-data="    public class TileSpawnerService: IService">`TileSpawnerService`</SwmToken>.

<SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/logic/tilespawner/TileSpawnerService.cs" pos="10:5:5" line-data="    public class TileSpawnerService: IService">`TileSpawnerService`</SwmToken> implements the <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> interface. This shows how a service class can adhere to the <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> contract, even though <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/game/service/IService.cs" pos="3:5:5" line-data="    public interface IService">`IService`</SwmToken> currently does not define any specific methods or properties.

```c#
ï»¿using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using game.service;
using Unity.VisualScripting;
using Random = System.Random;

```
