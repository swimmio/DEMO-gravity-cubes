title: Network Services Overview
---
Network Services handle the communication between the game and external servers.

They include functionalities for making HTTP requests, such as GET and POST requests.

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/network/user/UserService.cs" pos="11:8:8" line-data="            var getRequest = (HttpGetRequest)httpRequestFactory.CreateHttpRequest(HttpMethod.Get);">`HttpGetRequest`</SwmToken> class is responsible for executing HTTP GET requests and returning the response as a string.

The <SwmToken path="unity/four-block/Assets/network/score/ScoreService.cs" pos="11:8:8" line-data="            var postRequest = (HttpPostRequest)httpRequestFactory.CreateHttpRequest(HttpMethod.Post);">`HttpPostRequest`</SwmToken> class handles HTTP POST requests, allowing data to be sent to the server and returning the response.

The `IHttpRequest` interface defines a contract for executing HTTP requests, ensuring consistency across different request types.
